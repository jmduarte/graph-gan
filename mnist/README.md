# Generating MNIST datasets

Run [main.py](mnist/main.py) with the default parameters to start training. MNIST Superpixels graphs are generated by default, use `--sparse-mnist` to generate Sparse MNIST graphs. 

Models and sample graphs will be saved every five epochs in the models and figs directories respectively. FID scores and losses will be saved in the losses directory.
